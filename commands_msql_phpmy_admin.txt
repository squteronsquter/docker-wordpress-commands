# COMMANDS TO CREATE NETWORK AND START MYSQL AND PHPMYADMIN CONTAINERS ON THE SAME NETWORK FOR CONNECTIVITY

## EXAMPLE ONE

1. START MYSQL CONTAINER WITH CUSTOM ROOT PASSWORD (DEFAULT BRIDGE NETWORK)


docker run \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-password \
  mysql



2. START PHPMYADMIN CONTAINER (DEFAULT BRIDGE NETWORK)

(if you launched the phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin container before and it ip address is 172.17.0.2
check otherwise if you haven't launched it before)


docker run \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -e PMA_HOST=172.17.0.2 \
  phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin



## EXAMPLE TWO

### CREATE CUSTOM NETWORK (and assign "mysql" as its name - it is not the name of the image of mysql server)

docker network create mysql

3. START MYSQL CONTAINER WITH CUSTOM ROOT PASSWORD (ON CUSTOM BRIDGE NETWORK WITH NAME NAD CUSTOM NAME OF THE CONTAINER)

docker run \
  --network mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-password \
  --name mysql \
  -d mysql


4. START PHPMYADMIN CONTAINER (ON CUSTOM BRIDGE NETWORK WITH NAME AND CUSTOM NAME OF THE CONTAINER)

docker run \
  --network mysql \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -e PMA_HOST=mysql \
  --name phpmyadmin \
  -d phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin

## CHECK IF THE CONTAINERS HAVE BEEN CREATED AND ARE ON THE SAME NETWORK

docker ps

docker network inspect mysql

### IF YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

"Containers": {
            "94c87fd3759fa5a305d6f29028bbfafc950c12e7bd7a35ca93da3723900dcc18": {
                "Name": "phpmyadmin",
                "EndpointID": "2f974408c330276eb470da3b6dda4c7c245f97dd9806f474ede64ebbcd39a0fe",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            },
            "a4d786c33e4a4b3edcf448907abb2b62685efc8a9b6f5f3428a0879a303d5c96": {
                "Name": "mysql",
                "EndpointID": "e276f545d00c470c18f9f14fc61aeefec639e5b5a4b5d95b993f9642a91a1711",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:03",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.3/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
### AND ARE ABLE TO LOG INTO PHPMyAdmin PANEL ON: http://localhost:8080

### THEN YOUR JOB IS DONE - YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CREATED TWO CONTAINERS ON THE SAME CUSTOM NETWORK AND MAKE THEM TALK TO EACH OTHER
## ALL WORKED FINE IN MY CASE AND I AM ABLE TO USE PHPMYADMIN AND CREATE A NEW DATABASE
